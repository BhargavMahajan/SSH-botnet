	- This is a simple tool handy for linux administrators 
	in schools, colleges, etc where all the systems used by students
	in the lab or elsewhere have same usernames and passwords.

	- Future releases will be having a choice to input different usernames
	and passwords via a file.

	- This code was tested on a bunch metasploitable 2 servers.

	- Using this tool for illegal stuff is highly not recommended.

	- 'sudo' is unsupported. You can use root as username for superuser access.
